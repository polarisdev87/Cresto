            <li>3. Referral</li>

          <h3>Will there be a reinvest option?</h3>
          <p>Yes</p>
          <h3>Can you explain in plain English how does it work after I create ad campaign? I mean what do you do exactly with the money to make profit? </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1. We will run CPC and CPA ads for advertisers by sending high-targeted super leads to selected ad campaigns. 
              Revenue from that will be used to pay daily profit (+ initial capital).</li>
            <li>2. We are developing our own ad Network platform that will be used by Advertisers and Publishers. 
              This will generate a lot of volume and revenue for Crest and the income generated will be used to pay daily profit too. 
              It will be connected back-end to our Ad Server</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Want to know about lock up for staking or campaigns? (most staking platforms have lock ups that cannot be cancelled)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1. There is no lock up period for staking. It can be canceled anytime. </li>
            <li>2. For campaigns you can’t cancel; meaning that you get your capital daily plus the profit.
              <br>
              So for example, if your ad spend capital was $1000 then its divided evenly over the period of your 
              campaign + your profit or in other words you get daily 1.15 – 2.25% including your capital (so no capital return after the campaign period ends)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What happen to the token that users allocate to run advertising campaign? Do they lose it?</h3>
          <p>It is sold on the internal exchange to raise actual funds to run the campaign. It's like if you use dollar bill to pay for Google ads.</p>
          <h3>What is your projection in 12 months time?</h3>
          <p>We anticipate CSTT token to be trading around 100X ICO price in 12 months of full platform launch</p>
          <h3>You have run millions of dollars in ad campaigns to generate a profit?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Our ad team are currently running off an already successful ecommerce and affiliate marketing business that generates roughly 
            20 million visitors per month and an average of $780k per month in revenue</p>
          <h3>If you can make this kind of return already, then why do you need an ICO?</h3>
          <p>Google generated $17bn in revenue from ads last year. Why did they decide to raise more capital from institutional investors when they were only making $17m? 
            Simply to expand their business and increase their market share. </p>
          <h3>So after ICO you WON'T be able to use BTC or ETH to buy Crest with?</h3>
          <p>You can still buy CSTT using BTC or ETH on our Internal Exchange</p>
          <h3>Will you develop a smart phone App?</h3>
          <p>We may develop in the future. But right now we would like to focus on our main target which is to build an ad platform. 
            Our Lead Team will be thinking road ahead as we grow our community</p>
